# Autistic-kids-learning-assistant
This project focuses on designing and building an accessible learning application for children with
autism, cognitive delays, or hearing impairments. The goal is to help children learn and retain critical
personal and emergency contact information such as their name, address, and phone number in a safe,
engaging, and supportive environment. The application uses interactive games, visual exercises, and
AI-assisted guidance to make learning enjoyable while adapting to each child’s pace and abilities.
Accessibility and inclusivity are central to the design, ensuring that children with different learning needs
can effectively use the system.
Parents or guardians are able to monitor progress, receive notifications, and manage settings securely,
while children interact with a simplified, friendly interface.

The application must include AI-driven features that enhance learning:
• An AI-assisted learning coach that provides encouragement and guidance
• Adaptive difficulty that responds to the child’s progress
• A visual or sign-based learning assistant to support deaf or hard-of-hearing children
